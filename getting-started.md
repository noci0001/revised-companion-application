# GETTING STARTED
	
The following pages show how to execute the explained setup using Eclipse Velocitas and Eclipse Leda 0.1.0-M2.

## On a high level, you need to perform the following steps described in more detail in this guide:

1.Use the Eclipse Velocitas template repository to [develop, build and deploy your version of the seat adjuster example](https://sdv-blueprints.eclipse.dev/docs/companion-application/develop-seat-adjuster)

2.[Run Leda with QEMU (recommended)](https://eclipse-leda.github.io/leda/docs/general-usage/running-qemu/) and [manage the Eclipse Kanto container runtime to deploy your seat adjuster application.](https://sdv-blueprints.eclipse.dev/docs/companion-application/deploy-seat-adjuster)

3.Test the deployed setup by [interacting with the seat adjuster to change the seat position.](https://sdv-blueprints.eclipse.dev/docs/companion-application/interact-seat-adjuster)
